    <h1>Walkers Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Thank you for using Walkers. We highly value and respect your personal privacy, and we are pleased to provide you with detailed information on how we access data, the methods of obtaining data, the specific purposes of data usage, and how we enhance your experience with Walkers.</p>

    <h2>1. How We Access Your Data and Visualize It</h2>

    <p>Walkers requests access to your device's built-in pedometer data. We only obtain this data with your consent to generate visual statistical charts and calculate your daily calorie consumption, walking distance, and walking time. We assure you that under no circumstances will we transmit your personal data to third parties. Your personal data is stored exclusively within the Walkers app on your device and is deleted when the app is uninstalled.</p>

    <h2>2. Permissions Used by Walkers</h2>

    <p>To ensure the proper functioning of Walkers and to enhance your service experience, Walkers requests the following permissions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Activity Recognition Information Permission:</strong> Used to access your device's built-in pedometer data for generating visual statistical charts and calculating daily calorie consumption, walking distance, and walking time data.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage Permission (Applicable to devices running Android 9 and below):</strong> Walkers records your daily exercise data and provides a one-click sharing feature. This permission is used solely for temporary storage of user-shared content and does not permanently store or upload user data.</li>
